      <h2>2.Climate Policy Council</h2>
      <p>While each country has its set legal frameworks to govern climate
        change, less is known on how they conduct their duties or how they
        make progress on their climate advocacy.</p>
      <p>In this project, we advocate for the creation of a climate policy
        council to hold the government accountable and analyze policy set by
        the government and how it aligns to climate goals set by the
        Parliament and government. The Council will hold the government
        accountable through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bringing attention to societal effects of proposed policy</li>
        <li>Recognizing deficient policy</li>
        <li>Analyzing short- and long-term targets with climate and budget
          policy goals in mind</li>
        <li>Promoting discussion on climate policy in society</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The climate policy council need not be within a country in limitation
        of financial resources. We have countries such as Sweden, Denmark, and
        Chile which are leading in climate policy and they could come in
        agreement with developing countries and hold them accountable in their
        going green.</p>
      <p>Their involvement will help in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assessing the impact of current policies in various sectors on
          climate objectives</li>
        <li>Analyzing the societal repercussions of both established and
          forthcoming policies</li>
        <li>Recognizing the policy domains requiring supplementary actions to
          align with climate targets</li>
      </ul>
